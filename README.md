# Data preparation

All data for the phenological observations and environmental predictors is already publicly available. The only exception is the Zackenberg plot-level phenology observations, which we have included with the data preparation scripts in this repostiorty. 

The data preparation, cleaning and assembly scripts can be found in the following locations:
```
/data/phenology_data
/data/temperature_data
/data/sea_ice_data
```
Links to the raw data sets are provided in the readme files within each of the folder. Please follow these links for the respective data sharing and usage agreements of the respective datasets. 

The fowllowing script compiles the data prepared with the scripts above into a single dataset for later use in the analysis
```
/data/dataset_prep.R
```

# Data 
Interval censored phenology observation per site and plot with associated environmental predictor variables, fully cleaned and ready for analysis, can be found in the following location:
```
/data/coastal_phen.Rda
/data/coastal_phen.csv
```
The content of the Rda and CSV files is identical.
