# Sea-Ice Data Readme

These scripts prepare NOAA/NSIDC Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration Data available through the NSIDC via https://nsidc.org/data/G02202 on a per site basis, extracting mean daily sea-ice extent within a approx 500 km x 500 km bounding box around each site.

The NetCDF files for the time-period covered by the phenology datasets (1990-2016) will have to be downloaded locally, and the references to the NetCDF file locations need to be adjusted accordingly within each script. 

In additon the 'gsfc_25n.msk' and 'ps25area_v3.dat' polar stereographic grid files are required to run these scripts. The files can be found via the above link and documentation.
