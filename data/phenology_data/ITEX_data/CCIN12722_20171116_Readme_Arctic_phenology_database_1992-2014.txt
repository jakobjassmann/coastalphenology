README Long-term phenology data for 47 tundra plant species at 19 high-latitude sites.
CCIN Reference Number 12722

1. File names, directory structure (for complex datasets), and brief description of each file or file type: 
The datafile: CCIN12722_20161221_Arctic_phenology_database_1992-2014.csv is a .csv file containing dates of phenological events of 47 plant species at 19 sites in Arctic and sub-arctic alpine ecosystems. These data were compiled for a synthesis temperature sensitivity of plant phenology across northern ecosystems. 

If you are interested in using any phenological data from this database, please contact the relevant data providers.

More information on the synthesis that uses a subset of this database can be found in the publication:

4. Description of the parameters/variables (column headings in the data files) and units of measure for each parameter/variable:

site_name: Site name abbreviation that corresponds with above locations.
sub_name: Name of subsite location within site (if provided).
comm_type: Subsite moisture class (based on PI assessment of subsite, not always measured), DRY=<20% GMC (gravimetric moisture content), MOIST=20-60% GMC; WET=60%+.
lat: Latitude, decimal degrees N.
long: Longitude, decimal degrees E.
elevation: Elevation (meters).
ecosystem: Arctic zone, corresponding to High arctic, Low arctic, and Alpine sites.
exstart: First year of the experiment at the site, or first year of observations taken at the site.
year: year.
plot: plot within site (if provided). These codes are internal codes.
spp: 6 letter species code corresponding to the full name listed in each row in the 'genus' and 'species' column.
woody: Indicates if a species produces wood or not.
gfnarrowarft: Broad growth forms; values = FORBSV (forbs+seedless vascular), GRAMINOID, DSHRUB (deciduous), ESHRUB (evergreen shrub).
gfnarrowwalker: Narrow growth forms; values = FORB, GRASS, RUSH, SDECI (deciduous shrubs), SEDGE, SEVER (evergreen shrubs).
genus: genus.
species: species epithet.
phenophase: phenological phase of a plant observed on day.
 
Phenophase definitions: 
GREEN:  date of leaf emergence, when the first leaf was visible or open 
FLOWER: date that the first flower was open, first pollen visible, or first anthers exposed
FLOWEREND: date when anthers wilted or petals dropped
SENESCE: date when leaves start to change color if autumn
SeedMat: date when seeds are mature or fruits are ripe.

day: Day of year the phenophase was first observed (Julian days)
May_at: Mean May temperature in degrees C
June_at: Mean June temperature in degrees C
July_at: Mean July temperature in degrees C
August_at: Mean August temperature in degrees C
snowfree_date: First snowfree day per plot or site (Julian days)
data_providers: Names of individuals who provided each phenological observation
data_provider_email: Email addresses for data providers. If you are interested in using any phenological data from this database, please contact the relevant data providers.
 

5. Uncertainty, precision, and accuracy of measurements, if known: 
Phenological observations were taken from 1 – 3 times per week, depending on the site.

6. Environmental conditions, if appropriate (e.g., cloud cover, atmospheric influences, etc.): N/A

7. Method(s) for processing data, if data other than raw data are being contributed: N/A

8. Standards or calibrations that were used: N/A

9. Specialized software (including version number) used to prepare and/or needed to read the dataset, if applicable: N/A

10: Quality assurance and quality control that have been applied, if applicable: This database was assembled and checked for obvious errors (e.g. unrealistic outliers, obvious typos) by Janet Prevey. However, we cannot ensure that the database is entirely free of errors (such as observations being improperly recorded on datasheets).

11. Known problems that limit the datas use or other caveats (e.g., uncertainty, sampling problems, blanks, QC samples): N/A
